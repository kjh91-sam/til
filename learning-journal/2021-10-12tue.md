**script execution order and [tags `defer`&`async`](https://ko.javascript.info/script-async-defer)**
- Scripts are executed in order no matter how they're called. Whether the code is directly in the script tag or script is called via src address, (and for the Shopify, whether the script is called inside 'include' tag or script src is called via 'asset_url' tag) all of the script codes are excuted in order.
- Hoisting happens inside one script tag context.
- if use script tag property `defer`(지연 스크립트), 
  - the script is downloaded in background. And that deferred script is executed after the document is prepared and before `DOMContentLoaded` occurs. 
  - So if you use the code inside deferred script in middle of parsing the document, it might not be able to use that code. If you want to use the deferred code, use `window.onload` event-listener.
  - Only works when it's external script(using src)

**To combine `scale` and `sticky` doesn't work**
- when the wrapper get scaled, sticky child elements doesn't stick.. it behaves weird way.
